Many years ago someone created a pretty exhaustive .Net Library of FoxPro functions that were identified as nice Fox Stuff to have in .Net. They matched the function names, parameters and return types exactly, as I recall. The source code is available in C# or you can just download the DLL.

I just wanted to post this here in case it becomes a helpful source to use when VFP comes alive in X#.
